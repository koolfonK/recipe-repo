## My process

After I accepted the challenge, I began writing the HTML and CSS. 
I feel like it is all a bit messy because I didn't have a plan from 
the start but worked on things when they needed to be changed. When 
I didn't know how to do something I looked online for an awnser.
I worked mobile first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I practiced more basic HTML an CSS. 
I also praciced how to style the bullet points in a list

```css
li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  font-weight: bold;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to practice more with basic HTML and CSS while also trying some more advanced things.
